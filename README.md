forwarding
==========
I am not a coder, but I play one on tv. I am, however, a design engineer, an idea guy, and a megalomanic.  

the idea here is to build a call forwarding schedule/geo-fence app for an android phone. now the app may already exist, but that's no fun.  

this will be a half-assed attempt that will be orphaned before it's finished
